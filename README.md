# python-magento

This is a simple Python interface to Magento's XML-RPC API. The API discovers and
makes all of Magento's API methods available to you.

Note that this is only for magento 1, for magento 2 you would need a different library!

## Usage

```python
from magento import MagentoAPI

magento = MagentoAPI("magentohost.com", 80, "test_api_user", "test_api_key")

magento.help() # Prints out all resources discovered and available.
# cart: create, info, license, order, totals
# cart_coupon: add, remove
# ... (a bunch of other resources)
# sales_order: addComment, cancel, hold, info, list, unhold

magento.sales_order.help() # 'sales_order' is a resource.
# sales_order: Order API
#   - addComment: Add comment to order
#   - cancel: Cancel order
#   - hold: Hold order
#   - info: Retrieve order information
#   - list: Retrieve list of orders by filters
#   - unhold: Unhold order

# Let's list sales and add their subtotals!
orders = magento.sales_order.list()
subtotals = [order["subtotal"] for order in orders]
revenue = sum(subtotals)

# Additionally, you can get API metadata from these calls:
json_description_of_resources = magento.resources()
json_description_of_possible_global_exceptions = magento.global_faults()
json_description_of_possible_resource_exceptions = magento.resource_faults("sales_order")
```

The API discovers and makes all of Magento's API methods available to you. The
best way to learn how to use the API is to play around with it in a Python shell
and refer back to the [Magento API documentation](http://www.magentocommerce.com/api/soap/introduction.html) for docs on the usage of specific methods.

## Quick IPython Shell

The Magento API is massive and takes effort to grok. If you need to use it in some 
production capacity, you'll want to jump into a shell frequently and muck around
with inputs and stare at outputs.

`magento-ipython-shell` will drop you into an IPython shell that has a variable
bound to a MagentoAPI object that is ready for use. 

The shell requires IPython, which is the bee's knees. Install it and get it 
working first. Alternately, spin up a Python shell and instantiate the objects
you need. This is just a slightly nicer way to get started mucking around.

Here's how to launch it:

```
> magento-ipython-shell localhost.com 8888 api_user api_key

-- magento-ipython-shell -----------------
Connecting to 'http://localhost.com:8888/magento/api/xmlrpc'
Using API user/key api_user/api_key
Connected! The 'magento' variable is bound to a usable MagentoAPI instance.
-- magento-ipython-shell -----------------

Now you can mess around with the `magento` instance.

```
In [1] magento
Out[1]: <magento.MagentoAPI at 0x107d3c310>

In [2]: magento.help() # Lists all the resources available and their methods.
Resources:

cart: create, info, license, order, totals
cart_coupon: add, remove
... (many more)

In [3]: magento.cart.help() # Describes the methods available under a resource.
cart: Shopping Cart
  - create: Create shopping cart
  - info: Retrieve information about shopping cart
  - license: Get terms and conditions
  - order: Create an order from shopping cart
  - totals: Get total prices for shopping cart

In [4]: len(magento.sales_order.list()) # Play around with output.
Out[4]: 2
```

## Installation

python-magento is on PyPi:
